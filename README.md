### Overview
When I first read the project description, I was worried that this project would be one of the more involved and intricate prescribed in the Odin Project. However, once I completed the lessons on Webpack, it became very straightforward, and the actual webpage component itself was very intuitive (tabbed browsing is neat!). 

### Next steps for improvement
Throughout this project, I was more concerned with practicing using modules and separate files to package my code, as opposed to making the webpage look overly aesthetically pleasing. Thus, as is with a lot of these projects, I did not spend a huge amount of time making sure the outcome looked extremely good. Functionality wise, all the required components were there, and that's what I considered most important, along with practicing using modules and Webpack.
